# Weather-App
A simple and functional weather application that fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. This project highlights the use of JavaScript for API handling and dynamic updates.

# Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current weather information for any location.
Search Functionality: Users can search for weather by city name.
Dynamic Updates: Weather data updates dynamically on the page without requiring a reload.
Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or API issues.
Geolocation Support: Optionally fetches weather for the user's current location (if permissions are granted).

# Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for minimal styling (focused on functionality over design)
JavaScript for handling API calls and DOM manipulation
Weather API for fetching data

# How It Works
Enter a city name in the search bar to get the current weather details.
Weather details such as temperature, humidity, and condition (e.g., sunny, rainy) will be displayed dynamically.
If geolocation is enabled, the app can fetch and display the weather for your current location.
